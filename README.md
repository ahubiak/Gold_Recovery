# Gold_Recovery
Prepared a prototype of a machine learning model for a company that increases efficiency for heavy industry. The model predicts the amount of gold recovered from gold ore utilizing the data on extraction and purification. The model helps to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters through the use of calculated sMAPE (symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
